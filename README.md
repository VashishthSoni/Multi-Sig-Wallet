# Multi-Sig-Wallet
Here I made contract of Multisig wallet and also tested it With foundry solidity testing framework.
<br>
This wallet allow multiple users to create wallet where one user create transaction and execute only when required confirmations is satisfied.
<br>
Users can confirm transaction and revoke transaction. But only the user who created the transaction is allowed to execute after satisfied confirmation.
